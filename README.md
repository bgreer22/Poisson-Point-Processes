# Poisson-Point-Processes

In this project, I explore various properties of Poisson Point Processes while analyzing various distributions associated with them. Using the stats module in scipy, I perform various probabilistic calculations, including demonstrations of the probability mass function (PMF), the cumulative density function (CDF), and the probability point function (PPF). I show how we can create random variate samples to model discrepancies between theoretical values and real-world examples and how these differences disappear under the Law of Large Numbers. From there, I also examine properties extending to the Exponential distribution and the Erlang distribution - a special case of the Gamma distribution for phenomena with discrete occurrences. The project is carried out in Jupyter and integrates LaTeX to express the mathematical formulas that performed by pythonic functions.
